            <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
            <p><strong>Last Updated: December 28, 2025</strong></p>
            <p class="version">Bot Version: 2.0.0</p>

            <p>
                This Privacy Policy explains how the Buck Bot ("the Bot")
                handles data within your Discord server.
            </p>

            <h2>1. Data We Collect</h2>
            <p>
                We believe in minimal data collection. The Bot only processes
                the following information to function:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>User IDs:</strong> To identify users for moderation
                    actions (warnings, bans, kicks, timeouts), to track
                    authorized users for restricted commands (e.g., the download
                    command), and to associate actions with users.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Guild/Server IDs:</strong> To store server-specific
                    settings such as log channels, and to manage per-server
                    music queues.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Channel IDs:</strong> To know where to play music,
                    send logs, and execute commands.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Command Content:</strong> To process your requests
                    (e.g., search queries for music, moderation reasons).
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Message Metadata:</strong> For the message logging
                    feature (if enabled by server admins), we temporarily
                    process message content to generate logs. We do not store
                    message content on external databases.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Voice State:</strong> To manage music playback and
                    track which users are in voice channels.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>2. Data We Store</h2>
            <p>
                The following data is persistently stored in a local database
                file:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Server Settings:</strong> Log channel IDs and other
                    configuration options set by administrators.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Warning Records:</strong> When a user is warned, we
                    store their User ID, the reason, the moderator's ID, and a
                    timestamp. This data is used for the warning system and
                    auto-timeout features.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Authorized Users:</strong> A list of User IDs
                    authorized to use restricted commands like
                    <code>/download</code>.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>3. How We Use Data</h2>
            <p>Your data is used solely for the following purposes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    To facilitate music streaming, searching, and playback from
                    the connected Navidrome server.
                </li>
                <li>
                    To provide moderation tools including bans, kicks, timeouts,
                    warnings, purge, and slowmode.
                </li>
                <li>
                    To enforce automatic actions (e.g., auto-timeout after
                    reaching warning thresholds).
                </li>
                <li>
                    To update the Bot's status with the currently playing track.
                </li>
                <li>
                    To provide server activity logs in the designated channel
                    set by your administrators.
                </li>
                <li>
                    To restrict access to certain commands to authorized users
                    only.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>4. Data Retention</h2>
            <p>
                Most data processed by the Bot is ephemeral and stored in memory
                only while the Bot is running (e.g., music queues, current
                playback state). Persistent data (settings, warnings, authorized
                users) is stored until manually deleted by a server
                administrator or the Bot owner.
            </p>

            <h2>5. Data Security</h2>
            <p>
                All persistent data is stored locally on the Bot's host server.
                We do not sell, share, or transfer your data to third parties.
                Access to stored data is limited to the Bot owner for
                maintenance purposes.
            </p>

            <h2>6. Third-Party Services</h2>
            <p>The Bot interacts with the following third-party services:</p>
            <ul>

                </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>7. Your Rights</h2>
            <p>You have the following rights regarding your data:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>

                    warnings using <code>/warn list</code>.
                </li>

                    <strong>Deletion:</strong> Administrators can clear warnings
                    using <code>/warn clear</code>. To request complete deletion
                    of all stored data, contact the Bot owner.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Opt-out:</strong> Administrators can disable logging
                    features or remove the Bot from the server entirely to stop
                    all data processing.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>8. Children's Privacy</h2>
            <p>
                The Bot is not intended for users under the age of 13 (or the
                minimum age of digital consent in your jurisdiction). We do not
                knowingly collect data from children.
            </p>

            <h2>9. Changes to This Policy</h2>
            <p>
                We may update this policy occasionally to reflect new features
                or legal requirements. Continued use of the Bot after changes
                constitutes acceptance of the new policy. Significant changes
                will be announced where possible.
